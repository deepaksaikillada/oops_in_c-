/*
6. A special case of hybrid inheritance: Multipath inheritance: 
A derived class with two base classes and these two base classes have 
one common base class is called multipath inheritance. 
Ambiguity can arise in this type of inheritance. 
*/

//"car::func1" is ambiguous := it is ambiguous because vehicle has func1 and four-wheeler has func1 they both have same names, so the derived class car inherits the properties from the both base classes vehicle and four-wheeler, if we access the car class object . func1 then it will confuse which func1
    ///          because vehicle class has one func1
    ///         and also four-wheeler class has one func1
    ///         derived class has two func1's , , one is from vehicle and another is from four-wheeler which one it should access ,, so this is ambiguity
    ///     to avoid this ambiguity we use scope resolution operator

/*
In the above example, both ClassB and ClassC inherit ClassA, they both have a single copy of ClassA. However Class-D inherits both ClassB and ClassC, therefore Class-D has two copies of ClassA, one from ClassB and another from ClassC. 
If we need to access the data member of ClassA through the object of Class-D, we must specify the path from which a will be accessed, whether it is from ClassB or ClassC, bcoz compiler canâ€™t differentiate between two copies of ClassA in Class-D.
*/

/*
There are 2 Ways to Avoid this Ambiguity: 
1) Avoiding ambiguity using the scope resolution operator: 
Using the scope resolution operator we can manually specify the path from 
which data member a will be accessed, as shown in statements 3 and 4, 
in the above example. 
///obj.ClassB::a = 10;       // Statement 3
///obj.ClassC::a = 100;      // Statement 4
Note: Still, there are two copies of ClassA in Class-D.
///
2) Avoiding ambiguity using the virtual base class: 

#include<iostream>

class ClassA
{
  public:
    int a;
};

class ClassB : virtual public ClassA
{
  public:
    int b;
};

class ClassC : virtual public ClassA
{
  public:
    int c;
};

class ClassD : public ClassB, public ClassC
{
  public:
    int d;
};

int main()
{
    ClassD obj;

    obj.a = 10;       // Statement 3
    obj.a = 100;      // Statement 4

    obj.b = 20;
    obj.c = 30;
    obj.d = 40;

    cout << "\n a : " << obj.a;
    cout << "\n b : " << obj.b;
    cout << "\n c : " << obj.c;
    cout << "\n d : " << obj.d << '\n';
}
Output: 

a : 100
b : 20
c : 30
d : 40

According to the above example, Class-D has only one copy of ClassA, therefore, 
statement 4 will overwrite the value of a, given in statement 3.
