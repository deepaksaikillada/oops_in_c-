Certainly! In C++, both class and struct are used to define user-defined data types, but they have some differences. Let’s explore them:

Access Control:
Class:
Members (variables and functions) of a class are private by default.
You need to explicitly specify public, protected, or private access modifiers.
Struct:
Members of a struct are public by default.
You don’t need to specify access modifiers; everything is accessible from outside the struct.
Inheritance:
Class:
When you inherit from a class, the base class members are private by default.
Struct:
When you inherit from a struct, the base class members are public by default.
Typical Use Cases:
Class:
Used for encapsulating data and behavior (object-oriented programming).
Often contains private members and provides public methods.
Struct:
Used for simple data structures where members are directly accessible.
Typically used for grouping related data without methods.
Example:
// Example using class
class MyClass {
private:
    int x;

public:
    void setX(int val) { x = val; }
    int getX() { return x; }
};

// Example using struct
struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.setX(42);
    cout << "Value of x: " << obj.getX() << endl;

    Point p;
    p.x = 10;
    p.y = 20;
    cout << "Point coordinates: (" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")" << endl;

    return 0;
}

Notes:
You can use either class or struct for most purposes.
Choose based on your design needs and whether you want to emphasize encapsulation (class) or direct access (struct).
